    	polytomies using the old 'greedy' mode. This is not well suited for large
    	polytomies. Stochastic resolution will become the default in future
    	versions. To switch now, rerun with the flag `--stochastic-resolve`. To
    	keep using the greedy method in the future, run with `--greedy-resolve`
